2		any class or course in comprehensive sex education if his
3		parent or guardian submits written objection thereto, and

16		that is 100% effective against unwanted teenage pregnancy,
17		sexually transmitted diseases, and acquired immune deficiency
18		syndrome (AIDS) when transmitted sexually.
19		    (c) All classes that teach sex education and discuss sexual

9		    method of avoiding unintended pregnancy, sexually
10		    transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
11		        (4) Course material and instruction shall include a
12		    discussion of the possible emotional and psychological

17		    sexually transmitted diseases are serious possible hazards
18		    of sexual intercourse. Pupils shall be provided with
19		    statistics based on the latest medical information citing

9		    also encourage youth to resist negative peer pressure. The
10		    material and instruction shall include, with an emphasis on
11		    the workplace environment and life on a college campus,
12		    discussion on what constitutes sexual consent and what may

10		choose and adapt the developmentally and age-appropriate,
11		medically accurate, evidence-based, and complete sex education
