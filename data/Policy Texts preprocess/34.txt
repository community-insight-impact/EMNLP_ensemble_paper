Residents of the school district may enroll in such15		courses. The school board may establish fees and collect such16		charges as may be necessary for attendance at such courses in17		an amount not to exceed the per capita cost of the operation18		thereof, except that the board may waive all or part of such19		charges if it determines that the individual is indigent or20		that the educational needs of the individual requires his or21		her attendance at such courses.22		    (b) Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, from23		appropriations made for the purposes of this Section, the State24		Board of Education shall implement and administer a 3-year25		pilot program supporting the health and wellness26		student-learning requirement by utilizing a unit of  HB4442 Enrolled	- 6 -	LRB100 17751 AXK 32926 b1		instruction on parenting education in participating school2		districts that maintain grades 9 through 12, to be determined3		by the participating school districts.

The State Board of Education is authorized to15		make grants to school districts that apply to participate in16		the pilot program under this subsection (b). The State Board of17		Education shall by rule provide for the form of the application18		and criteria to be used and applied in selecting participating19		urban, suburban, and rural school districts. The provisions of20		this subsection (b), other than this sentence, are inoperative21		at the conclusion of the pilot program.
