     SECTION 1. Section 16-22-18 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-22 entitled
"Curriculum [See Title 16 Chapter 97 - The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is hereby
amended to read as follows:
     16-22-18. Health and family life courses.
     (a) Every secondary school teaching courses in family life or sex education within this
state shall include, as part of the course instruction, abstinence from sexual activity and refraining
from sexual intercourse as the preferred method of pregnancy prevention and the prevention of

sexually transmitted diseases. Provided further, part of the course instruction may incorporate

age-appropriate elements of effective and evidence-based programs on the law and meaning of

consent. Such age-appropriate elements of effective and evidence-based programs on the

prevention of pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and sexual violence may include

instruction that increases student awareness of the fact that consent is required before sexual

activity.

     (b) Upon written request to the school principal, a pupil not less than eighteen (18) years


of age or a parent or legal guardian of a pupil less than eighteen (18) years of age, within a


reasonable period of time after the request is made, shall be permitted to examine the curriculum


program instruction materials at the school in which his or her child is enrolled.


     (c) A parent or legal guardian may exempt his or her child from the program by written
directive to the principal of the school. No child so exempted shall be penalized academically by reason of the exemption.

     SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
