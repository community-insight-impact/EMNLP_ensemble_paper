5 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that young people 6 should have the knowledge and skills necessary to build healthy 7 relationships, and to protect themselves from unintended pregnancy and 8 sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. The primary 9 responsibility for sexual health education is with parents and 10 guardians. However, this responsibility also extends to schools and 11 other community groups. It is in the public's best interest to ensure 12 that young people are equipped with medically and scientifically 13 accurate, age-appropriate information that will help them avoid 14 unintended pregnancies, remain free of sexually transmitted diseases, 15 and make informed, responsible decisions throughout their lives. 16 (2) The legislature intends to support and advance the standards 17 established in the January 2005 guidelines for sexual health 18 information and disease prevention developed by the office of the 19 superintendent of public instruction and the department of health.1 These guidelines are a fundamental tool to help school districts, 2 teachers, guest speakers, health and counseling providers, community 3 groups, parents, and guardians choose, develop, and evaluate sexual 4 health curricula to better meet the health and safety needs of 5 adolescents and young adults in their communities.6 NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 28A.300 7 RCW to read as follows: 8 (1) By September 1, 2008, every public school that offers sexual 9 health education must assure that sexual health education is medically 10 and scientifically accurate, age-appropriate, appropriate for students 11 regardless of gender, race, disability status, or sexual orientation, 12 and includes information about abstinence and other methods of 13 preventing unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. All 14 sexual health information, instruction, and materials must be medically 15 and scientifically accurate. Abstinence may not be taught to the 16 exclusion of other materials and instruction on contraceptives and 17 disease prevention. A school may choose to use separate, outside 18 speakers or prepared curriculum to teach different content areas or 19 units within the comprehensive sexual health program as long as all 20 speakers, curriculum, and materials used are in compliance with this 21 section. Sexual health education must be consistent with the January 22 2005 guidelines for sexual health information and disease prevention 23 developed by the department of health and the office of the 24 superintendent of public instruction. 25 (2) As used in this act, "medically and scientifically accurate" 26 means information that is verified or supported by research in 27 compliance with scientific methods, is published in peer-review 28 journals, where appropriate, and is recognized as accurate and 29 objective by professional organizations and agencies with expertise in 30 the field of sexual health including but not limited to the American 31 college of obstetricians and gynecologists, the Washington state 32 department of health, and the federal centers for disease control and 33 prevention. 34 (3) The superintendent of public instruction and the department of 35 health shall make the January 2005 guidelines for sexual health 36 information and disease prevention available to school districts, 37 teachers, and guest speakers on their web sites. Within available1 resources, the superintendent of public instruction and the department 2 of health shall make any related information, model policies, 3 curricula, or other resources available as well. 4 (4) The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with 5 the department of health, shall develop a list of sexual health 6 education curricula that are consistent with the 2005 guidelines for 7 sexual health information and disease prevention. This list shall be 8 intended to serve as a resource for schools, teachers, or any other 9 organization or community group, and shall be updated no less 10 frequently than annually and made available on the web sites of the 11 office of the superintendent of public instruction and the department 12 of health. 13 (5) Public schools that offer sexual health education are 14 encouraged to review their sexual health curricula and choose a 15 curriculum from the list developed under subsection (4) of this 16 section. Any public school that offers sexual health education may 17 identify, choose, or develop any other curriculum, if the curriculum 18 chosen or developed complies with the requirements of this section. 19 (6) Any parent or legal guardian who wishes to have his or her 20 child excused from any planned instruction in sexual health education 21 may do so upon filing a written request with the school district board 22 of directors or its designee, or the principal of the school his or her 23 child attends, or the principal's designee. In addition, any parent or 24 legal guardian may review the sexual health education curriculum 25 offered in his or her child's school by filing a written request with 26 the school district board of directors, the principal of the school his 27 or her child attends, or the principal's designee. 28 (7) The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall, 29 through its Washington state school health profiles survey or other 30 existing reporting mechanism, ask public schools to identify any 31 curricula used to provide sexual health education, and shall report the 32 results of this inquiry to the legislature on a biennial basis, 33 beginning with the 2008-09 school year. 34 (8) The requirement to report harassment, intimidation, or bullying 35 under RCW 28A.600.480(2) applies to this section.
